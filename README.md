# 🌸 Passiflora Mitochondrial Genome

This repository contains the workflow used for the **mitochondrial genome assembly** of three *Passiflora* species:  
*Passiflora edulis*, *Passiflora alata*, and *Passiflora haematostigma*.



## 🧬 Workflow Overview

The pipeline includes the following steps:

1. 🧷 **Read alignment** to a reference mitochondrial genome  
2. 🧬 **Mitochondrial genome assembly**  
3. 🧠 **Gene annotation**  
4. 🔍 **Comparative genomic analysis**


📁 All commands are organized within this repository.
